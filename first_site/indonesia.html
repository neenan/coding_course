      <h2>Indonesia</h2>
		  <p>In July 2009 i travelled to Hoga, a small Island in the Wakotobi Marine National Park in Indonesia. I worked with Operation Wallacea, an organisation that operates biological and conservation management research programmes in remote locations across the world. I worked as a research assistant where my main role was to help scientists and thesis students collect data for their projects. After completing a course in coral reef ecology I helped on several different projects including biotope mapping, symbiosis between fish and heliofungi, and coral diseases. As well as these projects i spent a week living on a boat conducting marine mammal surveys and reef check surveys.</p>
